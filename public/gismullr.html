            <h1>Hi there</h1>

            <p>Iâ€™m Gisele Muller Sasso. Wife, mom, Jazzercise instructor, aspiring writer and occasional runner. A Brazilian currently living in beautiful Santa Cruz, CA.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™ve moved to the United States in 2011 after a project me and my husband launched together got some  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/mentaway/">attention from TechCrunch</a> and opened a few doors. Many years, a kid and a mortgage later Iâ€™m pretty happy with how things turned out.</p>

            <p>For the past three years, Iâ€™ve decided to put everything on hold to enjoy motherhood and I loved it. Now Iâ€™m slowly starting to get my feet wet again doing some freelance writing and project management work.</p>

            <p>I have a business degree and worked for a few big companies back in the day. I love writing and Iâ€™m really passioned about dancing. How do you combine these?</p>

            <p>You become a Jazzercise instructor to fulfill your dance related dreams. You mix the corporate background and writing skills and start managing side projects and writing copy for websites and blogs.</p>

            <p>You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/gismullr">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gismullr/">Instagram</a>.
            And Iâ€™m working up the courage to publish all my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@gismullr">Medium</a> one of these days. Keep you posted.</p>
