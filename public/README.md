# Hi

I'm Eduardo Sasso, a Brazilian expat working in tech in Silicon Valley.

I'm currently based in Santa Cruz, CA, enjoying family life with my wife and daughter.

In 2011, I moved to the U.S. to join Trip.com (formerly Gogobot), which was [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/ctrip-group-snaps-up-travel-search-startup-trip-com/) by [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/) in 2017.

As a software engineer, I'm agnostic to language and tools but I've got a soft spot for [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Surfing is a big part of my life. The ocean is where I like to be and riding waves is my form of meditation.

[Rocky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/) is my favorite movie. I really relate to the underdog story and the never-give-up attitude.

I'm a morning person, coffee drinker and banana eater; a pragmatic minimalist and a student of [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).

Sometimes I post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eduardosasso) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eduardosasso/) and I occasionally write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@eduardosasso).

Cheers!
