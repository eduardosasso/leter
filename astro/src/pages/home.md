Hi, I’m [Eduardo Sasso](mailto:eduardo.sasso@gmail.com), a Brazilian expat turned American working in tech in Silicon Valley.

I'm based in [Santa Cruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz,_California), California, living a quiet family life with my wife, daughter, and our dog Maui.

In 2011, I moved to the U.S. to join Trip.com (formerly Gogobot), which was [acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/01/ctrip-group-snaps-up-travel-search-startup-trip-com/) by [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.net/) in 2017.

I'm into building things, mostly software products, and lately, I've been dabbling into woodworking and moonlighting on [Bullish▲](https://bullish.email) Stock Market in my free time.

As an [engineer](/resume), I'm a generalist and agnostic to languages and technology, but I enjoy writing [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) code quite a bit.

I find balance and tranquility in the ocean, and surfing has been a big part of it for most of my life. 

[Rocky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/) is my favorite movie. I really relate to the underdog story and the never-give-up attitude.

I'm a morning person, coffee drinker, banana eater, pragmatic minimalist, and occasional practitioner of [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism).

Every so often, I publish on my [Blog](/blog) but most likely commit on [Github](https://github.com/eduardosasso) and sometimes post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eduardosasso) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/eduardosasso/).

Let's [connect](mailto:eduardo.sasso@gmail.com)!
 
Cheers 〜
