```

## Getting Started
After installing Leter go to the root folder of your project in the terminal and run:

```bash
leter --new 
```

This will create a file called **leter.yml** with the following options:

```yaml
theme: default
date_format: "<%= Leter::DATE_FORMAT %>"

google_analytics:
```
Customize your website by editing this file, disable features you don't need by either removing the key or removing its value.

Work on your content by creating markdown files like the example below:

```bash
.
├── blog
│   ├── being_productive.md
│   ├── consistency.md
│   ├── first_post.md
│   └── leter_is_awesome.md
├── index.md
├── leter.yml
└── resume.md
```

To build your website into HTML run:

```bash
leter --build
```

Leter creates the HTML alongside your markdown files, and the final structure of your site will look similar to this:

```bash
.
├── blog
│   ├── being-productive
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── being_productive.md
│   ├── consistency
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── consistency.md
│   ├── first-post
│   │   └── index.html
│   ├── first_post.md
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── leter-is-awesome
│   │   └── index.html
│   └── leter_is_awesome.md
├── index.html
├── index.md
├── leter.yml
├── resume
│   └── index.html
└── resume.md
```

Markdown files like **blog/first_post.md** are translated into **blog/first-post/index.html** so you can get clean and SEO friendly URL's.
Also, note under **blog** the file **index.html** is a listing page with links for all the posts in that folder.


To safely remove and clean all the HTML and assets generated by Leter run:
```bash
leter --clean
```
